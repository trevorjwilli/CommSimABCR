\title{Calculate Summary Statistics}
\usage{
ecosumstats(y)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{Either a metacommunity matrix or a list of metacommunity matrices}
}
\value{
Either a vector of summary statistics for a single metacommunity or a dataframe where columns
are different summary statistics and rows are metacommunities.
}
\description{
Calculates summary statistics on metacommunities to be used in ABC analyses.
}
\details{
Calculates the mean, median, and standard deviations for shannon diversity index,
simpson diversity index, Pielou's evenness, richness, the number of sites occupied for species.
It also calculates beta diversity by calculating the mean and sum of squared
interpoint distances using pairwise Bray-Curtis dissimilarities (Anderson 2011),
and true alpha, beta, and gamma values using Hills numbers for q = 0 through 2 Jost (2006, 2007),
These values are calculated using equal weights for all values of q as well as weighted
for q = 1. It also calculates the C-score (as well as skew and variance of C-score), checkerboard score,
V-ratio. Lastly it calculates the number of embedded absences, Turnover, and Morisitas
 index following Leibold and Mikkelson (2002).

meta <- CommSimABC::rand_meta(20, 30, 500)
ecosumstats(meta)

metas <- replicate(20, rand_meta(20, 30, 500), simplify = FALSE)
ecosumstats(metas)
