\usage{
make_priors(n.spec, n.site)
}
\arguments{
\item{n.spec}{Numeric, the number of species in the metacommunity}

\item{n.site}{Numeric, the number of communities in the metacommunity}
}
\value{
Creates a \emph{priors} object which is a list containing 10 elements.
  jdist: One of 1 or 2, specifies a uniform or normal prior distribution for the community size.

  jparams: A 2L Numeric vector. If jdist = 1 then the first value is the minimum and the
  second value is the maximum. If jdist = 2 then the first value is the mean and the second
  value is the standard deviation.

  seldist: One of 1, 2, or 3, specifies a uniform, normal, or gamma prior distribution for the selection
  coefficients for each community.

  selparams: A 2L Numeric vector. If seldist = 1 then the first value is the minimum and the
  second value is the maximum. If seldist = 2 then the first value is the mean and the second
  value is the standard deviation. If seldist = 3 then the first value is the shape parameter
  and the second value is the scale parameter.

  fddist: One of 1 or 2, specifies a uniform or normal prior distribution for the frequency dependence parameters.

  fdparams: A 2L Numeric vector. If fddist = 1 then the first value is the minimum and the
  second value is the maximum. If fddist = 2 then the first value is the mean and the second
  value is the standard deviation.

  migdist: One of 1 or 2, specifies a uniform or normal prior distribution for the migration distance.
  Can be a vector with length equal to the number of species in simulations to give each species its own
  migration distance prior distribution

  migdistparams: A 2L Numeric vector. If migdist = 1 then the first value is the minimum and the
  second value is the maximum. If migdist = 2 then the first value is the mean and the second
  value is the standard deviation. Can also be a list of 2L numeric vectors specifying prior distribution
  parameters for each species individually.

  migprobdist: One of 1 or 2, specifies a uniform or normal prior distribution for the migration probability.
  Can be a vector with length equal to the number of species in simulations to give each species its own
  migration probability prior distribution

  migprobparams: A 2L Numeric vector. If migprobdist = 1 then the first value is the minimum and the
  second value is the maximum. If migprobdist = 2 then the first value is the mean and the second
  value is the standard deviation. Can also be a list of 2L numeric vectors specifying prior distribution
  parameters for each species individually.
