Description: This package runs metacommunity simulations following a modified 
    Moran model which can then be used for model selection and parameter estimation 
    in an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) framework using the abc package. 
    These simulation models can help researchers determine which metacommunity archetype
    is most likely influencing metacommunity structure as well as elucidate the amount
    and direction of dispersal between communities.
